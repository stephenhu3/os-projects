PA6 Question 1

Assume that you need to compile the kernel in a special way, different from the way
the official kernel is compiled in. Explain in detail the steps you need to take in order to
rebuild the Linux kernel (consider Ubuntu if distribution-dependent). Clearly mention
which source(s) (Webpages, books, …) you use as reference.

Firstly, in order to get the kernel source, we will need to obtain the source for an Ubuntu release.
There are two ways of doing this:

1. Apt-get: This method should be used if a user wants to make changes to the kernel already installed on 
their system. Using this will result in the source code being obtained.
2. Git: This method should be used to get the sources if the goal is to get the most up to date sources. Each 
release has its source in its own git repository, so git can be used to obtain them.

Secondly, we'll need to set up the necessary build environment. Certain packages will be needed in order 
to get the environment ready to successfully build the kernel. 

Next, if necessary, the configuration needs to get modified. If we don't want any configuration 
changes, then this can obviously be skipped. Assuming configuration changes are indeed desired, we 
can run commands to call menuconfig in order to edit the config file of the current configuration 
for the architectures supported.

Finally, we need to build the kernel. As our source has stated, by changing the "working directory to 
the root of the kernel source tree" and proceeding to type certain "fakeroot" commands, the task should be done. 
Assuming the commands work properly, some sets of binary package files will be produced in a directory above the build root directory.

Now, we can test the new kernel.
